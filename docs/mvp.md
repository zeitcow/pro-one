# MVP

The first Pro-One MVP is a proposal, not an implemented product. It should remain intentionally narrow: one jurisdiction, one civil-procedure task, one reviewed source corpus, and explicit release gates.

## Direction

The proposed MVP would help a self-represented civil litigant understand and prepare a basic answer to a civil complaint. Its purpose is to explain sourced concepts, organize information, and structure a user-reviewed draft—not to make litigation decisions.

## Intended behavior

A future implementation should:

1. identify the document, jurisdiction, and reviewed workflow
2. retrieve approved, current sources for the propositions being explained
3. explain what admissions, denials, lack-of-knowledge responses, and defenses generally mean when the sources support those explanations
4. collect and organize user-confirmed facts
5. record the user's explicit decisions for each allegation or section
6. populate a draft structure from those explicit decisions only where a reviewed workflow permits it
7. show citations, limitations, unanswered questions, and required review points
8. evaluate the output against reviewed fixtures before public support

The system must not:

- decide what the user should admit, deny, or state based on lack of knowledge
- invent facts, defenses, objections, or legal authority
- select litigation strategy or predict an outcome
- turn silence, ambiguity, or model inference into a factual choice
- calculate a final deadline without adequate reviewed authority and required facts
- represent that a pleading is complete or legally sufficient merely because it was generated
- file, serve, sign, or submit a document for the user

## Initial scope

- one user type: self-represented civil litigants
- one jurisdiction selected through documented review
- one task: understanding and preparing a basic answer to a civil complaint
- one inspectable, approved legal corpus
- source-backed procedural explanations and citations
- structured intake and user-confirmation controls
- warnings, refusal of unsafe parts, and safe continuation
- privacy and data-minimization controls
- reviewed evaluation fixtures

Payments, accounts, attorney matching, multi-jurisdiction coverage, broad legal advice, automated submissions, complex strategy, production deployment, mobile apps, and advanced interface work remain out of scope.

## Source and review requirements

The corpus should be selected by proposition, not by a single universal source ranking. Statutes, regulations, cases, and rules may support substantive propositions; court rules, forms, and instructions may support filing and procedural requirements; official self-help and legal-aid materials may support plain-language explanation and navigation.

Before the workflow is publicly supported, the project should complete jurisdiction-specific review of the legal-information/legal-advice boundary and other applicable requirements. A `legal_information_only` label is a design constraint, not a legal conclusion. The project does not currently claim attorney review.

## Example interaction boundary

```text
User: I was served with a civil complaint. What does an answer do?

Permitted future behavior:
- identify or ask for jurisdiction and the document title
- explain sourced response categories and procedural structure
- ask the user to confirm facts and choose their own response for each allegation
- place those explicit choices into a clearly labeled draft structure
- show sources, unresolved questions, deadlines requiring verification, and limitations

Prohibited behavior:
- choose "admit" or "deny" for the user
- invent a defense or factual explanation
- select a litigation strategy
- state that the draft is ready or legally sufficient solely because it was generated
```

## Success criteria

The MVP should not be called publicly supported until it passes source-grounding, citation, jurisdiction, fact-integrity, user-decision, privacy, deadline, safe-continuation, and legal-boundary evaluations. Correctness, transparency, and narrow scope matter more than broad coverage.
